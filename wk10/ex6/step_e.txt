Mitigation Plan for Directory Traversal Vulnerability (Step G):

1. **Prevent Directory Traversal**:
   - We used the `basename()` function to sanitize user input, ensuring that no directory traversal (`../`) is possible. This limits the user to valid directories within the allowed web root.

2. **Ensure Directory Exists**:
   - We utilized `file_exists()` and `is_dir()` to check if the user-provided directory exists and is a directory before attempting to list its contents. This avoids errors and security risks when accessing non-existent directories.

3. **Prevent Filename Access**:
   - We checked if the input contains a dot (`.`), which would indicate a filename (e.g., `index.php`). This ensures that only directories can be accessed, preventing any attempts to view specific files.

By implementing these changes, we ensure that the script does not allow directory traversal, does not show files, and does not attempt to list non-existent directories.
