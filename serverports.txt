1) What is the definition of a server port?
Server port is a communication endpoint used by the server to listen for incoming requests from clients. Each port is identified by a unique number (1–65535) and is associated with specific services or protocols.

2) What is the server port range?
1 to 65535, divided into three ranges: well-known ports (1–1023), registered ports (1024–49151), and dynamic/private ports (49152–65535).

3) How many bits does the number above represent?
16 bits.
Explanation:
The maximum value of a server port is 65535.
- To find how many bits represent 65535, calculate 
- 2^16 = 65536, which means 16 bits are required to represent port numbers.
